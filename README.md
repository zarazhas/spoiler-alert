# Spoiler Alert

  ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

  ## Description
Picture this. You are scrolling social media just like any other day. Suddenly, you come across a post by someone you know. As you begin to read their post, they spoil the big twist ending of the movie you were going to watch this weekend. It is enough to ruin your whole day!

We present to you, Spoiler Alert. This is a message board that provides a safe space for users to make sure that certain titles are not spoiled for them if they don't want them to be. 

Each post will have the contents and comments hidden from a user unless they want to click a button to reveal what is being said about that program. This way, if they see a post on our message board for something they haven't seen yet, they know with confidence that nothing will get spoiled for them until they are ready. 

We may not be able to prevent the entire internet from spoilers, but at least we know of one place that tries to be just a little bit better.

  ## Future Development
  This was a group project done in 2 weeks for our Coding Bootcamp. If we had more time and resources, we would like to improve these features in a future development of the app.

  * We would like to restrict the access of a post based on if the user had seen the movie instead of having the button to open up the comments
  * Create a more robust profile page to include the option to add a profile picture and populate the movies the user has and hasn't seen
  * Direct them to a website that will let them know which platform is streaming that title so that they can watch it. 
  * Connect to a third party API to populate movie and tv show images instead of the film roll placeholder image.
